This is a React front-end app for the [MS Focus Shop](https://github.com/sethjeffery/ms-focus).

## Running the app

```
yarn start
```

It is expecting the API to be running on http://localhost:3000. Therefore the initializer will ask
you if you wish to use a different port to 3000, you should say "Yes"!
